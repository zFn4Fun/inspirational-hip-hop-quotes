# Inspirational Hip Hop Quotes

[Live Demo](http://zfn4fun.github.io/projects/hhquotes)

Inspirational Hip Hop Quotes is a random quote app composed of inspirational
quotes from various Hip Hop artists that came up from nothing and ended up
"making it", as a reminder that everything is possible.

Every quote is accompanied by a background image of the artist it originated
from.

## Purpose

This project was made as part of my portfolio. The main reason for its creation
was to practice JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and Media Queries.
It was also my first project to integrate the Twitter and Facebook buttons, and
my first attempt at Babel, Gulp task runner and its plugins, and the NPM/Node
ecosystem.
