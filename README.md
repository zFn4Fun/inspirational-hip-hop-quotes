# Random Hip Hop Quotes

[Live Demo](http://zfn4fun.github.io/projects/hhquotes)

## What is this

This is a Random Quote Machine composed of inspirational quotes from various
Hip Hop artists that came up from nothing and ended up "making it", as a
reminder that everything is possible.

Every quote is accompanied by a background image of the artist it originated
from.

## Purpose

This project was made as part of my portfolio. The main reason for its creation
was to practice JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and Media Queries.
It was also my first project to integrate the Twitter and Facebook buttons, and
my first attempt at Babel, the Gulp taskrunner, and the NPM/Node ecosystem.

The background images were taken from various websites via Google.
